# Frontend Design Refresh Plan

Summary:
- The frontend uses Vite + React + Tailwind and `shadcn/ui` primitives. This plan collects UI improvement ideas and component updates.

Goals:
- Increase consistency across pages using shared `SectionCard` and `Chart` components.
- Expand theme palettes in `src/themes/` and expose theme selector in UI.
